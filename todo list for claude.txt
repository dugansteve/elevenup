-make the scroll bar wider on mobile phones on the right side of the screen on the Teams, Clubs, and Players ranking pages so that if you scroll to the bottom after loading lots of data, you can easily get back to the top.

-some teams on the Teams page just have the club name and others have the age listed.  Let's remove the age from all team names in the table of the Teams page since it is listed in the next column under Age. However, when you click on a team and it takes you to that teams page, lets add the age back onto the team name that is in large green font at the top of the page.  Right now the age is in small gray text underneath and hard to notice.

-make the green boxes on the individual team pages smaller for power score, record, goal diff, and win %.  Put their US rank, state rank, and league rank by gender/age (eg G13, B09, etc...).

-when Show Predictions is enabled in the Games tab of the individual Team page, allow the past results to be listed as Results by Date or Ranked by Performance with Ranked by Performance as the default.

-enable the user to click on any team names in the list of games on a individual Team page to take them to that teams page.

I need a robust system for player and parents to claim an existing player profile or create a new player profile and claim it.  Claiming it gives them the right to edit the profile including uploading a photo or building an avatar, choosing whether to show the last name or just the last name initial, associate the player with a specific team (and switch teams), you need a pro account to claim a player.  An individual parent can claim no more than 3 players on a single team and no more than 8 players in total.

Each Pro user gets an AI Team Analysis 2x a week. the AI analysis looks at all the teams in a particular conference, looks at the existing records and current standings in the conference and league, looks at the remaining games the rest of the year, takes all the teams individual rankings and certainty scores, and creates a detailed analysis of the odds of every team to win the conference with standard deviations, what the predicted order of finish will be of each team with standard deviations, and the probability and standard deviation for every single order of finish for a single team.
